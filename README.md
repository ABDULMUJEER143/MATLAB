Software Requirements: MATLAB (2023b).
Intially run the input file (with temperature in kelvin).
Now run the modified two diode model file 
Now open the pv model file and don't run it
open "comp3" file and run the file and wait for the result to display it. 
Results will be obtained as RSME minimum value and the value is approximate. If the result is 0.00917, it will be approximated as 0.0092.
